What we need to know
12. Click on the particular SSID as shown in figure 12, in this lab we have selected 
WSTREAM AP0 SSID
Now you have to select another SSID for comparison
13. Scroll down the SSID and select WStream AP -1
14. Click on the 2.4 GHz channels tab
16. it will show 2.4Ghz channels for two SSID, WStreamAP1 and WStreamAP0 
17. Click on 5Ghz channel
Thus, you can see the signal strength for both the SSIDs

In this way, we can analyse wireless network strength with the help of SSIDer tool


What is inSSIDer?
inSSIDer is a diagnostic tool for Wi-Fi networks that's geared toward SMEs, IT admins, and techie internet users. It displays Wi-Fi access point information, such as channel type and width, signal strength, maximum data rate, and security, with graphs and bar charts. The tool shows neighboring Wi-Fi networks' impact, hidden networks, and how busy other channels are. It makes recommendations for quieter channels to boost Wi-Fi speed. It scans the LAN for devices and their usage, and it identifies devices that may pose a security risk.
